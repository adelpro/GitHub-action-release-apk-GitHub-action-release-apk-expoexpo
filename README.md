# GitHub Action: GitHub-action-release-apk-expo

This GitHub Action automates the process of building an Android APK for an Expo project whenever a new tag is created. It generates a release from the tag and attaches the built APK to the release assets, ensuring that each version has a downloadable APK directly linked to its release.

## Key Features:

    Automated APK builds: Automatically compiles your APK whenever a new tag is pushed.
    Tag-based Releases: Generates a new GitHub release for each tag.
    APK in Release Assets: Attaches the built APK to the newly created release for easy access.
    Expo EAS Integration: Leverages Expo's EAS (Expo Application Services) to build the APK seamlessly.
