# GitHub-action-release-apk-GitHub-action-release-apk-expoexpo
This GitHub Action automates the process of building an Android APK for an Expo project whenever a new tag is created. It generates a release from the tag and attaches the built APK to the release assets, ensuring that each version has a downloadable APK directly linked to its release.
